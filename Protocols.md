### [Internet Protocols]()
The Internet Protocol family contains a set of related (and among the most widely used network protocols. Beside Internet Protocol (IP) itself, higher-level protocols like [TCP](), [UDP](), [HTTP](), and [FTP]() all integrate with IP to provide additional capabilities. Similarly, lower-level Internet Protocols like ARP and ICMP also co-exist with IP. In general, higher level protocols in the IP family interact more closely with applications like Web browsers while lower-level protocols interact with network adapters and other computer hardware.

### [Wireless Network Protocols]()

Thanks to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and LTE, wireless networks have become commonplace. Network protocols designed for use on wireless networks must support roaming mobile devices and deal with issues such as variable data rates and network security.

### [Network Routing Protocols]()

Routing protocols are special-purpose protocols designed specifically for use by network routers on the Internet. A routing protocol can identify other routers, manage the pathways (called routes) between sources and destinations of network messages, and make dynamic routing decisions. Common routing protocols include EIGRP, OSPF and BGP.
